This folder contains version lists.

This folder lets you access recent versions and older versions.

You can run files only if the kernel version is 0.0.5.6 on Linux, but you can run any on Windows.

NOTICE: Because of GitHub's limits in repositories, we don't ship binaries that include the VLC library starting with 0.0.8. These isolated binaries can be run on Linux. To run it on Windows, you have to go to Releases to download the full binaries; they won't limit file sizes over 100 MB, but limits them over 2 GB.
